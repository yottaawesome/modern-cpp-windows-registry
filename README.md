# Source code for "Use Modern C++ to Access the Windows Registry"

## Introduction

This is an unofficial source code repository for [Giovanni Dicanio's](https://github.com/GiovanniDicanio) May 2017 MSDN article on using modern C++ to read and write to the Windows Registry: [Use Modern C++ to Access the Windows Registry](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2017/may/c-use-modern-c-to-access-the-windows-registry). The code is consolidated here for my own reference and convenience, and remains the copyright of Giovanni Dicanio.

## Using this repository

You can simply clone this repo and open the SLN file `ModernCppWinReg.sln` located in the `src` directory with any version of Visual Studio 2019. You'll need the _Desktop Development with C++_ Visual Studio workload to be able to run the sample, which will just lookup from the Windows Registry the current version of Firefox installed on your machine.
